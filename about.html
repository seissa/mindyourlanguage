    <h2>About This Dictionary</h2>

    <p>This dictionary was born out of frustration and empathy for other users facing the same problem. Many of us struggle with understanding and managing new words, especially in professional environments where jargon can be overwhelming. This platform aims to simplify that process, providing a user-friendly tool to add, search, and manage words. By sharing this tool, I hope to help others enhance their vocabulary and make learning more accessible and enjoyable. As every organisation will have its own vocabulary, please help to build up the repository by emailing me with more suggestions!</p>
